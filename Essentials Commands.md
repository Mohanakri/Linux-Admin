# 1.Login into Local,Remote & Text Mode

The transcript provides an overview of different methods to log into a Linux system, comparing it to logging into apps or websites using a username and password. It describes four login methods: local text mode console, local graphical mode console, remote text mode login, and remote graphical mode login. 

### Key Concepts:

1. **Console and Terminal**:
   - **Console**: A screen displaying text from the operating system, allowing login and command typing.
   - **Terminal Emulator**: A graphical app in a window that performs similar functions to a console.

2. **Local vs. Remote**:
   - **Local**: Directly accessing a physically available computer or laptop.
   - **Remote**: Accessing servers or computers over a network, such as a server running in Google Cloud.

3. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
   - Servers usually don't have GUIs, but if they do, logging in is straightforward with a user list and password input.

4. **Text-Based Login**:
   - For servers without GUIs, text-based login involves typing the username and password directly.

5. **Remote Graphical Login**:
   - Various solutions like VNC (Virtual Network Computing) or RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) are used, requiring appropriate clients like TightVNC or RealVNC.

6. **Remote Text-Based Login with SSH**:
   - Most Linux servers use OpenSSH daemon for secure remote logins.
   - **SSH** (Secure Shell) replaced **Telnet** due to its strong encryption and security.
   - **OpenSSH** is widely trusted and used for its reliability and security.

7. **Practical Steps**:
   - Find the serverâ€™s IP address using `ip a` command.
   - Use an SSH client to connect: MacOS/Linux have pre-installed clients; Windows 10/11 also come with built-in SSH clients.
   - Example command: `ssh username@IP_address`.

The transcript emphasizes the importance of understanding different login methods, the historical context of terms like console and terminal, and practical steps to securely log into a Linux system.

# 2.Login into Local,Remote & Text Mode:Hands_ON 

The transcript details a demonstration of logging into Linux machines using various methods, both locally and remotely. Here are the key points:

1. **Local Graphical Login**:
   - The presenter logs into a local Ubuntu machine with a graphical desktop interface.
   - Selects a username and enters a password.
   - Demonstrates using the graphical desktop and terminal emulator.
   - Logs out when done.

2. **Remote Graphical Login Using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)**:
   - From a Windows machine, the presenter connects to a remote Ubuntu machine with XRDP installed.
   - Uses the Remote Desktop client on Windows, inputs the IP address of the remote machine (10.0.0.81).
   - After a certificate warning, the login screen for the remote Ubuntu machine appears.
   - Enters the username and password to access the Ubuntu desktop remotely from Windows.

3. **Remote Text Mode Login Using SSH**:
   - Demonstrates connecting to a remote Linux server without a desktop interface using SSH.
   - On Windows, Mac, or Linux, opens a terminal and types `ssh username@IP_address` (or domain name).
   - On the first connection, confirms the security prompt by typing "yes".
   - Enters the password to access the terminal of the remote Ubuntu machine via SSH.

The demonstration concludes with a brief mention of the next topic: built-in system documentation.

# 3.Read & Use System Documentation

The transcript provides a detailed guide on how to access help manuals and documentation in Linux using various commands. Here are the key points:

1. **Command Line Help**:
   - Use `--help` with any command (e.g., `ls --help`) to get a quick overview of available options.
   - Useful for remembering command options that you may forget over time.

2. **Man Pages**:
   - Access detailed manuals using the `man` command (e.g., `man journalctl`).
   - Man pages provide comprehensive information about commands, including descriptions, syntax, and examples.
   - Use `man man` to see the different sections of man pages and how to specify them (e.g., `man 1 printf` for the command and `man 3 printf` for the function).

3. **Apropos Command**:
   - Use `apropos` to search man pages by keyword if you don't remember the exact command (e.g., `apropos directory`).
   - May need to update the database with `sudo mandb` if it's the first use.
   - Filter results by section using `-s` option (e.g., `apropos -s 1,8 directory`).

4. **Autocompletion**:
   - Use tab for autocompletion to save time (e.g., typing `systemctl` followed by a tab).
   - Double tab shows a list of suggestions if multiple completions are possible.
   - Autocompletion works for commands, options, filenames, and directory names.

5. **Practice**:
   - Regular practice with `man` and `--help` will improve your ability to quickly find and understand command usage.
   - This is particularly useful for exams like the LFCS, where quick access to information is crucial.

By using these tools and techniques, you can efficiently navigate and utilize Linux commands, even when you don't remember all the options or exact commands.

# 4.Create,Delete,Copy,Move files & Directories

The transcript explains how to manage files and directories in Linux, covering basic commands and concepts. Here are the key points:

1. **File System Basics**:
   - **File System Tree**: The Linux filesystem is structured like an inverted tree with the root directory ("/") at the top.
   - **Absolute Paths**: Begin with "/" and specify the complete path from the root directory (e.g., "/home/aaron/documents/invoice.pdf").
   - **Relative Paths**: Do not start with "/" and are relative to the current directory (e.g., "documents/invoice.pdf").

2. **Listing Files and Directories**:
   - `ls -la`: Lists all files, including hidden ones, in long format.
   - Combine options like `ls -al` or `ls -lh` for detailed and human-readable file sizes.

3. **Navigating Directories**:
   - `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
   - `cd [path]`: Change the current directory. Use absolute paths (e.g., `cd /var/log`) or relative paths (e.g., `cd ../` to go up one directory).

4. **Creating Files and Directories**:
   - `touch [filename]`: Create a new file (e.g., `touch receipt.pdf`).
   - `mkdir [directory]`: Create a new directory (e.g., `mkdir receipts`).

5. **Copying Files and Directories**:
   - `cp [source] [destination]`: Copy files (e.g., `cp receipt.pdf receipts/`).
   - `cp -r [source directory] [destination directory]`: Copy directories and their contents recursively (e.g., `cp -r receipts backup_of_receipts`).

6. **Moving and Renaming Files and Directories**:
   - `mv [source] [destination]`: Move or rename files and directories (e.g., `mv receipt.pdf receipts/` to move, `mv receipt.pdf old_receipt.pdf` to rename).

7. **Deleting Files and Directories**:
   - `rm [filename]`: Delete a file (e.g., `rm invoice.pdf`).
   - `rm -r [directory]`: Delete a directory and its contents recursively (e.g., `rm -r invoices`).

8. **Command Tips**:
   - Use `.` for the current directory and `..` for the parent directory in relative paths.
   - `cd -`: Return to the previous directory.
   - `cd` without arguments takes you to your home directory.

By understanding these commands and concepts, you can effectively navigate, manage, and manipulate files and directories in Linux.

# 5.Create & Manage Hard Links

The lecture explains how Linux manages hard links and compares them to soft links. Key points include:

1. **Basic Concepts**:
   - **Users**: Aaron and Jane have separate accounts on a shared Linux computer.
   - **File Creation**: Aaron saves a picture, "family_dog.jpg", in his directory.

2. **Inodes**:
   - **Inodes**: Unique identifiers that store metadata and point to data blocks on the disk.
   - **File Linking**: A file name points to an inode, which tracks data locations and metadata.

3. **Hard Links**:
   - **Definition**: A hard link is a new file name that points to the same inode as the original file.
   - **Command**: `ln [target file path] [link file path]` creates a hard link.

4. **Advantages of Hard Links**:
   - **Storage Efficiency**: Hard links allow multiple users to access the same data without duplicating it, saving disk space.
   - **Deletion Independence**: Deleting one hard link does not affect the others; the data is only deleted when all links are removed.

5. **Limitations**:
   - **File System Constraints**: Hard links can only be created within the same file system.
   - **Permissions**: Users need appropriate permissions to create and access hard links.

6. **Practical Use Case**:
   - **Sharing Files**: Aaron and Jane can share "family_dog.jpg" using hard links, enabling both to access the same file without duplicating data.
   - **Deletion**: If Aaron deletes his link, Jane can still access the file until she deletes her link too.

7. **Permissions**:
   - **Group Access**: To share hard links, users may need to belong to the same group with the necessary permissions.
   - **Permission Changes**: Changing permissions on one hard link updates the inode, affecting all linked files.

This approach allows efficient data sharing and management in Linux while ensuring data is only removed when no longer needed by any user.

# 6.Create & Manage Soft Links

This transcript explains how Linux manages symbolic (soft) links, comparing them to shortcuts in Windows. Here are the key points:

1. **Windows Shortcut Analogy**:
   - In Windows, a shortcut on the desktop points to an executable file elsewhere on the disk.
   - Double-clicking the shortcut launches the application.

2. **Soft Links in Linux**:
   - **Definition**: Soft links are similar to shortcuts; they point to a file path rather than an inode.
   - **Creation**: Use the `ln -s [target path] [link path]` command to create a soft link.
   - **Example**: To create a soft link to an image, use `ln -s /home/Aaron/pictures/family_dog.jpg shortcut.jpg`.

3. **Listing and Inspecting Links**:
   - Use `ls -l` to list files and directories, which shows soft links with an "l" at the beginning and the path they point to.
   - Use `readlink [link path]` to display the target path of a soft link.

4. **Permissions**:
   - Soft link permissions are generally not important.
   - The permissions of the target file apply when accessing through the soft link.

5. **Absolute vs. Relative Paths**:
   - Absolute paths can break if the directory structure changes.
   - Relative paths keep the link intact even if the directory names change.

6. **Linking to Directories and Across File Systems**:
   - Soft links can point to directories.
   - Soft links can also point to files and directories on different file systems.

By using soft links, you can create flexible and convenient references to files and directories, similar to shortcuts in Windows, without worrying about duplicating data.
